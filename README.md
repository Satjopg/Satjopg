# Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

- 😎 I am currently working as a web engineering manager.
- 🧑‍💻 I like both backend and frontend, but I have more experience as a backend engineer.
- 😆 I enjoy analyzing various problems, forming hypotheses, and working toward solutions. I am especially interested in the problems themselves.
- 📫 Please take a look at my idea, ["Shizukana Internet"](https://sizu.me/satjopg) or ["Zenn"](https://zenn.dev/satjopg)!
